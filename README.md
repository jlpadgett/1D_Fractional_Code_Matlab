# 1D_Fractional_Code_Matlab
This repository contains the initial 1D code for a fractional Laplacian code to model Anderson localization

Some notes:

1. My updated suggestion is that you run New_AndersonF2
2. While using influence = 1000 sounds nice (in theory), I feel that these may lead to a compilations of unecessary errors
3. The best results are occuring for very small values of c (say, c = 0.0005 or c = 0.0001)

There is also all of the needed LaTeX files in the "1D Article" folder.
